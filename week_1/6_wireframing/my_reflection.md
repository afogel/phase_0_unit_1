* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

For my own edification, I'm going to try to reiterate/paraphrase much of what I believe I understood about design thinking in order to convey what I learned:

Design is an elaborate process in which, through a great deal of feedback and reiteration, an elegant solution for a well-defined problem is brought forward. It frequently requires a good amount of repetition, brainstorming, research, and revisiting in order to come up with a novel solution. But even before the solution is created, a good amount of energy needs to be exerted in order to define the problem appropriately. 
The process of design thinking begins frequently with some immersive observational period, potentially looking at successful outliers for a given outcome and trying to identify what makes them so successful through research. Importantly, during this stage of design thinking, it's critical to cast as wide a net as possible in order to have a large number of potential solutions to work from Next, design thinking requires sifting through the massive amount of observational data and attempting to identify the most important/effective solutions to a given problem. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither are great ideas, so occasionally this entire process needs to be repeated because what you may have come up with at first simply wasn't the best approach. It's important to maintain humility through the process so that you can accept when you simply haven't got it right. Finally, once the idea is refined, design thinking requires the producers of the given solution to implement it.
User experience is like design thinking, but applied to, well, the user's experience. Basically, you apply the design process (ideally) to the problems that users might and do experience when interacting with your product (in this case) and then trying to find elegant solutions through Design Thinking.

I like design in theory, but I am still finding it frustrating to both be my own critic and implement changes that best address the issues I've found. Also, with simple sites like the ones we've created to date, there's not too much of a problem that's being addressed, or at least, not too complex a problem. I expect that it will become both more challenging and more rewarding to work through UX and design once we start getting into more complex work.

One question I was unsure of was what the best practices of UX really are--we read a lot about design thinking generally, but not how to use UX. Also, there's a significant body of literature from behavioral economics and related fields that are directly applicable to UX, but I didn't see any mention of that or ways to incorporate those into design.

I learned how to wireframe? I think that a lot of design practices are fairly intuitive and straightforward, but the followthrough and making sure one doesn't skip steps are probably the most important part. That having been said, it's also great that the steps (or interpretations of steps) for successful design are fleshed out in black-and-white.

I'm very confident in my understanding of the Learning Competencies of this challenge.
I enjoyed reading about the process behind design, but I thought that drawing up wireframes felt pretty tedious.
