## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

First, you must go to your GitHub profile, click on the "Repositories" tab on the top of the screen, and click the green "New" button at the top right. You then enter the desired repository name, a description of the repository, select the privacy settings for the repository, and choose to initialize the repository with a README as well as what kind of license you would like to be included in the README.

Once the repository (repo) is created, you can clone the repo by going to the main page of the repo, finding "HTTPS clone URL" on the right hand side menu (midway down the page), and copy the link right underneath it. You should then go into your command line interface, and type "git clone [paste the link to the repo here] [type the directory name on your computer you want to clone the repo to here]".

Open source means that as a developer, you share the code behind your software in a free and unrestricted way so that it can be modified and redistributed by others.

I appreciate Open Source. For me, while I may not want to always share in the open source projects, I think that transparency and the sharing of code only makes for a more collaborative environment and ultimately helps developers continue to improve and strive for their best. I also appreciate the wonderful aspect of open source that someone with a different background and est of experiences can reimagine the core functionality of your software and implement it in new and novel ways. The only thing that makes me nervous if negotiating the balance of giving back to the worldwide community of developers and monetizing one's projects/eeking out a living by coding.

Licenses are important because they help establish clear (or intentially ambiguous) property boundaries for a developers' work. While the motivation behind open source is increased transparency and collaboration, we want to make sure the original developers are appropriately attributed and have control over how their software is distributed and modified. Licenses guard against theft and ensure that open source, at it's core, remains respectful and collaborative. 

The concept of licenses were solidified in this challenge. I now understand the difference between a CC licenses and others, though I've seen many types of licenses around for a while now.

I didn't use any outside information when attempting to understand the materials better.
