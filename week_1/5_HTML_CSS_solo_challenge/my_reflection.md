I was a bit befuddled by getting the positioning of various elements correct, especially the footer. After some careful reading of the css (and also reviewing the codecademy materials), I was able to figure out that I needed to "clear: both;".
I'm still a bit confused about how to appropriately estimate how many pixels are needed for a certain part and how many I can leave to auto. I'm also having difficulty understanding how some of the inheritance works, since 
I'm having trouble getting images to behave appropriately on the websites. Heck, one thing I'm still confused about in general is just why when I keep futzing with the CSS it seems as though it only messes up everything even more and I can't seem to dig myself out of the whole without restarting from fresh.
Learning about how to float elements was a really cool new trick. I can't wait to keep experimenting more with it.

I feel very confident using HTML tags to present information on a website, and while I feel competent in my understanding and using of margins, padding, and borders, it still doesn't feel as right as rain.
I enjoyed seeing the final product, but man did mucking about with CSS feel tedious. Hopefully, with additional experience, it will become more manageable.
