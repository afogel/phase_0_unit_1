I learned that DNS stood for Domain Name System and that DNS servers keep track of pairing IP addresses to domain names. To access any given website, a computer will contact a DNS server to locate that website's IP address, then it will directly contact the website's server using that IP address to "GET" the webpage.

One thing that's pretty important to remember when setting up your HTML site is that you need to make sure that you always include closing tags and declare the code to be HTML using the <html> tag. Also, it's pretty crucial that you make sure that if you're linking to an image, make sure that you are linking to the correct directory.

The feeling I first felt when I saw my web page live? W00000000000000T!!!!!!!! 'Nuff said ;)

One concept that was solidified was the difference between the internet and the world wide web. That is to say, the WWW are the websites we see in browsers, while the internet is the connection of various computers to each other using the same rules/protocols.
