Hey all!
My name is Ariel Fogel and I'm based in Washington DC (though I'm currently traveling in Israel!). My favorite websites based on design are dappered.com, uber.com, and google.com. I'm an audio-visual kinesthetic learner, so I'm definitely someone who needs to get their hands dirty experimenting with new concepts, but I respond very well to seeing someone walk through an example before setting me off to go on my own.
Here's a link to my reflection file:  https://github.com/afogel/phase_0_unit_1/blob/master/week_1/7_get_to_know_your_group/my_reflection.md

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.
