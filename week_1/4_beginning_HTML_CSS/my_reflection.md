What makes sense about HTML? It's a markup language that doesn't have any logic embedded in it. It creates static pages and provides the basic foundation for a website. Nothing doesn't really make sense about HTML to me.
The good aspects of HTML are that it's fairly readible, as in all code manipulations are easy to understand/interpret. The bad aspect of HTML is that it could probably get really muddled and illegible, really quickly, if you're not careful. If you have too much text on a page and a lot of formatting, it may be difficult to parse out what is what and where if falls on the page.
It was cool to solidify my grasp on linking CSS to HTML docs as well as using relative versus absolute references to include objects like images (or linking to the CSS!).
Nope!
