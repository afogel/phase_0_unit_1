Blog url: http://afogel.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I don't particularly enjoy blogging. As far as recieving comments or views, I have not recieved them yet (to my knowledge). The blog was helpful in the sense that by using a template to evaluate multiple websites, I was able to parse out similarities in what I found to be appealing and effective design. I did feel like some of the questions were cumbersome (I had difficulty coming up with a 5th adjective for most of them). What I liked most was the question about where your eye is drawn on the homepage, as well as ease of navigating the pages/accessing all the content. I felt less certain about drawing a comparison between adjectives for the visual aesthetic compared to adjectives relating to content and focus of the website.
