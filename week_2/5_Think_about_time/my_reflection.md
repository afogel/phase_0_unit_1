# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

after I go to the bathroom, I will meditate for 1 minute.
Currently, my biggest time management challenge during Phase 0 is juggling daily responsibilities and errands with the workload, along with some wandering focus issues. I think by setting up a routine for myself and making sure that I do some work every single day, I should be able to stay on top of the tasks at hand.
I think I'm going to try to implement many of the habit-building techniques that were suggested in this challenge; I'm going to try the Pomodoro technique to build focus, though I may cut it down to 15 minute segments to start with. I also want to try to incorporate small pockets of mindfulness meditation using the Fogg method--I just need to figure a good trigger that I would like to use.
While I have a number of travel plans scheduled ahead of me, I plan on trying to sit down and work as much as possible over the next few months. At the very least, I want to complete one challenge every day.
