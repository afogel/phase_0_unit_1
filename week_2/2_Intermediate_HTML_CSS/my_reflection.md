# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

I think that web standards are pretty good, overall. As with any standards, they simplify our lives as developers by creating expectations that browsers and developers will conform to writing and interpretting code in a specific way every time.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

I think standard structure makes sense to me, more or less?...I guess something that was confusing to me was the fact that the term "standard structure" doesn't seem to be a universally used term and the slides don't make explicit referrence to it, so it's a bit confusing to me what the term referring to. If it's referring to the way that certain elements of a web page have pre-set sizes or presentations, then it makes sense to me. 

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

I like the new HTML5 elements; they are well thought out, given that almost every single website follows a certain layout with a header, footer and some type of navigation panel. By including dedicated tags for commonly found elements of a web page, readibility is increased/clutter is decreased.
* Why is reset.css necessary? 

Some HTML elements, such as links and bulleted lists have preset formats and settings. Reset.css gets rid of those elements.
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

I've used IE, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. I have noticed that some sites looked different in different browsers and I think it's a pain that they do. Honestly, when you create a website layout, as a designer/developer I would want to have as much of a consistent UX as possible, regardless of how people access my site.
