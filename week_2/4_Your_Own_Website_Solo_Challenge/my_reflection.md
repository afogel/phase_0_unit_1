# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: afogel.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?

There are a lot of aspects to design and user experience that sometimes we might take for granted. For example, one thing that I hadn't spent much time thinking about but really resonated with me was how many ways there are to show users where they are on a site/how they navigated to a place. You can leave a breadcrumb trail, or show through the use of psuedoclasses where a person is on the site. I'm still figuring out how to do everything I'd like, but I put some thought and effort into more carefully constructing navigation of my site.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I like design and user experience...the only thing is that, for the time being, I'm so focused on trying to make CSS do what I want (though it's slowly improving!), that it's hard for me to get further beyond rudimentary design and UX. I actually enjoyed wireframing, though I think I need to spend more time researching sites whose layout I like even more! I may find myself getting a pintrest soon :)

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

I knew what I wanted the basic layout to look like because I was inspired by a handful of websites, not least of all the very impressive Ron Ishak. On the other hand, I think that part of the way I want my site to work requires incorporating some javascript, especially the part where I don't want to have to go to a completely new site every time someone clicks on a <nav> tab. Also, I'm not sure how to stretch an entire image over multiple CSS table cells. Finally, I couldn't figure out how to make the current tab "highlighted"....I think that's some JS work.


* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

At some point soon, I'd like to improve the color scheme...I've tried using various color wheels, but I really feel as though no matter what colors I use, I somehow keep recreating a very 1990s feel. Next? Add the features I couldn't figure out that I mentioned above.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

It was pretty difficult to apply the material I learned...I think a lot of it is higher level concepts for more developed projects. Also, I'm kind of building this website more for myself and DBC as a proof of concept than for users; without direction of what I anticipate users would want (aside from a speedy load time! Still need to figure out how to incorporate that fully), I'm not sure where I might start with my site.


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
