# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive web design is a way of designing website for various sizes windows/browsers. Basically, by employing responsive web design, a site's layout will dynamically adapt to browser size instead of remaining fixed and showing the same content regardless of the browser window's size. I think it's a great practice as there are various types of browsers with different sizes (PC versus Tablet versus Mobile), so this allows the developer/designer to appropriately deliver a fitting UX based on the user's browser size and needs at a given moment. Sometimes, a page or app is used differently depending on how the user accesses it, right?

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

By introducing new screen sizes besides the old standard of "mobile vs. PC", smartphones and tablets have radically changed the way designers have approached creating websites. With the addition of these devices, users increased the potential uses that websites could have based on the medium in which they were accessed. Additionally, with the use of touch-based interaction versus use of a mouse, the way in which developers approach creating a UI altered from simple links to more buttons. I honestly can't imagine what future technology might be incorporated, but I would guess that future web design will incorporate more structure to provide as fluid a UI regardless of which medium accesses the app/site.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

I know that Ray Kurzweil developed a reader for visually impaired people, so I imagine that a similar tool exists for websites; for those who have difficulty distinguishing between colors, I also imagine there are apps that can interpret websites' color schemes and display them in easy to distinguish color schemes for the colorblind. I think that we should design and develop for visually impaired based on the application of the site; that is to say, if the site/app we build is meant to service a particular group, such as the visually impaired or the elderly, we absolutely should. Additionally, for commerce sites that are geared to large swaths of the internet-using population, we should also consider all types users including the visually impaired. Actually, upon further reflection, it seems like very few sites should not consider visually impaired users when designing the sites.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

The idea that we should have a responsive design for the sites we build really resonates with me. Though I may not be very good at it yet, I'd like to believe that I care a great deal about UX and the idea that it's poor form to develop a one-size-fits-all-browser-windows makes a good deal of sense to me. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

While I personally didn't find it, I found the video posted to the hangout by Arik to be pretty useful:
