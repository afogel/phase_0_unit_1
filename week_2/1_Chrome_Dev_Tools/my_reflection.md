# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
The DOM is a way of structuring and organizing an HTML document in a tree-like format, where tags contained within other tags are contained as "branches" of the larger structure. It seems like a natural way to organize a document like an HTML page, but I can also see a potential drawback--if you have a ton of nested HTML code, I imagine it can be very challenging to target the exact area you want to modify due to the size of the tree. In other words, the DOM seems like it could get unweildy very fast.
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
Chrome Web Tools exposed both the simplicity of my site compared to the wordpress.com site, as well as demonstrating ways that I could better optimize my site :P
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
I found Chrome Web Tools to be helpful, although complex. I'm sure that as time continues and I become more comfortable with the Tools, I'll be able to enjoy working with it much more.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
The concept of the DOM was solidified for me--before it seemed much more obscure, but seeing it visually represented in Chrome Web Tools definitely helped me get an intuitive understanding of it.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
No.
